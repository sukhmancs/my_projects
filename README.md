# My Projects
## Introduction

Welcome to my Github repository where I showcase my programming projects. In this repository, you will find a directory structure that contains different projects that I have worked on. Each project is contained in a separate folder, and I have also categorized the projects based on the programming language used.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

- `google_colab`: This folder contains projects that were finished using Google Colaboratory. It includes various projects, such as a simple chatbot using nltk, sentiment analysis using trax library, math question solver, data exploration using the Titanic dataset, typing speed tester, patient survival prediction, and more.

- `HTML/CSS/Java/Javascript`: This folder contains projects specific to the programming language.

## Projects
### Google Colab

This project contains various notebooks showcasing different machine learning models and algorithms. Some of the notable projects include:
- `Chat_bot_nltk.ipynb`: A simple chatbot using nltk.
- `sentiment_analysis_with_trax.ipynb`: A Twitter sentiment analysis machine learning model using trax library.
- `sentiment_analysis_naive_byes.ipynb`: A simpler version of Twitter sentiment analysis using naive byes.
- `word_embeddings.ipynb`: Building word vectors using the continuous bag of words model on Shakespeare text.
- `maths_questions_solver.ipynb`: Solving mathematical problems such as finding missing digits from a given number for it to be divisible by another number and finding the sum of any sequence of numbers.
- `Data_exploration_using_titanic_dataset.ipynb`: Understanding data and dealing with duplicates, recognizing, and treating missing or NAN values.
- `TypingSpeedTester.ipynb`: A basic typing speed tester.
- `patient_survived_prediction.ipynb`: Predicting patient survival rates based on the number of diseases they have.
- `Gradient_descent.ipynb`: Implementing the gradient descent algorithm from scratch using Python.
- `auto_complete_using_n_gram.ipynb`: Completing a sentence based on the context.
- `spell_checker.ipynb`: Checking if the spelling of a typed English word is correct.

## Projects I am Currently Working On: 
This section contains various projects that I am currently working on, including:
- `Machine_translation_encoder_decoder_with_attention`: A powerful machine translation system to translate from English to German.
- `named_entity_recognition_with_trax`: A short but complex system to detect named entities written using the trax library.
- `question_duplicates_using_siamese_network_in_trax`: A system to detect whether two questions are duplicates of each other, which is helpful in platforms to detect if a question posted already exists to keep only one appropriate copy of the question.
- `Text_generation_using_GRU_using_trax`: Creating long text based on summaries or tags.
- `Translation(Linear transformation of word vectors)`: A translation system.
- `Transformer summerizer`: Attention based transformer to summerize long textual data.
