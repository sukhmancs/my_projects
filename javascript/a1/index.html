                        Coming to college, my main goal was to learn and become an expert in the field of computer science. I wanted to gain a deep understanding of the intricacies of computer science and how it can be used to solve problems. I also aimed to develop the skills necessary to apply this knowledge in a practical setting, such as building and designing software systems. <br><br>
                        Throughout my time in college, I have had the opportunity to take a variety of classes and participate in different projects that have allowed me to explore the field of computer science in depth. Through group projects and research opportunities, I have learned to think creatively and apply my knowledge in new and innovative ways.<br><br>                       
                        Overall, my time in college has been a fulfilling and exciting journey, and I am confident that the knowledge and skills I have gained will help me to achieve my goal of becoming an expert in computer science. I am excited to continue to explore the field and apply my knowledge in the real world.
